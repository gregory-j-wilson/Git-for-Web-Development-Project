Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        inline takes up part of the width of a page and something else can go next to it, but block takes up whole width and something else goes below it on a new line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        You can move it wherever you want - on top of other things
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        Use percentage - like 100% to fill the whole width of the parent element (div) 
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
       Block: div, p, h1 // Inline:  img, span  //  Inline-block: button
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
          The box model is how css decides to put space inside or outside the box, using padding, margin, and borders.  The fix to always keep width constant, regardless of padding and border,
          is css property:  box-sizing: border-box.
